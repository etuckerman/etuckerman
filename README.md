<p align="center">Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a software developer passionate about machine learning, AI, and building innovative projects. </p><p align="center">I love the machine learning/AI field and exploring new and exciting challenges in this space.</p>

<h2 align="center">🔭 Current Projects</h2>

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Gameplay Analysis for CS:Surfing**: Developed an advanced AI system that uses on-screen recognition to analyze gameplay recordings of Counter-Strike surfing. The system processes video inputs to extract critical gameplay data, identifies key actions, and provides actionable feedback to enhance player performance. This project leverages computer vision techniques and real-time analysis to deliver insights directly from the gameplay experience.

- 📊 **Contextual Response Generator for CS:Surfing Community**: Created a sophisticated tool that takes user queries related to the Counter-Strike surfing community and finds the most relevant message from a massive dataset of over one million messages. Using the `paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2` model, the system generates embeddings for these messages. `Mistral-7B-v0.1` is then employed to refine the response based on the retrieved message and user query, ensuring precise and contextually relevant answers. This project integrates advanced natural language processing and machine learning to enhance user interaction and information retrieval.

<h2 align="center">🎓 Courses Completed</h2>

- **Sheffield Hallam University Computer Science / Machine Learning and Heuristics**: Completed with a First Class Bachelor’s with Honours and a 4.0 GPA.
- **Hugging Face NLP Course**: Gained extensive knowledge in natural language processing techniques and models.
- **CS50AI**: Advanced my skills in artificial intelligence through this comprehensive course.

<h2 align="center">🌱 Goals</h2>

- 🔍 Deepen my understanding of machine learning models and algorithms.
- 🚀 Collaborate with others on innovative AI and machine learning projects.
- 📈 Contribute to open-source machine learning projects.
